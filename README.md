# Seasonal Mood Tracker

A small web app for recording moods and scheduling therapy reminders. It is built
with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite** and stores data locally in your
browser.

## Features

- **Mood Entry** – track mood, energy, sleep quality, light exposure and notes.
  When geolocation is available the entry is tagged with your coordinates.
- **Calendar** – view past entries on a monthly calendar and tap a day to see
  details.
- **Therapy Scheduler** – set daily times to receive notifications reminding you
  about therapy activities.
- **Timer** – a simple countdown timer.
- **Customization** – toggle dark mode, choose a seasonal theme (Spring, Summer,
  Autumn or Winter) and adjust notification frequency.
- **Streak Counter** – see how many days in a row you've entered your mood.

## Browser requirements

The app asks for permission to send **notifications** and to access
**geolocation**. Notifications are used by the therapy scheduler and daily
check‑ins. Geolocation allows mood entries to be tagged with your location. All
features continue to work if permissions are declined, but reminders and
location data will be unavailable.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies before running any build or lint step:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the linter after installing dependencies:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Styles are generated by Vite and Tailwind during the build or development process.
You'll only see them when running `npm run dev` or after building with `npm run build`
and serving the files from the `dist/` directory. Opening `index.html` directly
without building will omit all CSS.

## User preferences and seasonal theming

Customization settings are managed with a zustand store and persisted to
`localStorage`. On the **Customize** page you can toggle dark mode, select a
season and set how frequently notifications should appear. These choices are
loaded when the app starts so your preferred theme and settings remain across
visits.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
  ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
  ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```

## Calendar and date utilities

The calendar page uses [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) for working with
dates. Install dependencies, including this library, with:

```bash
npm install
```

See `src/pages/Calendar.tsx` for usage examples.
