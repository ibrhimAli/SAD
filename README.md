# Seasonal Mood Tracker

A small web app for recording moods and scheduling therapy reminders. It is built
with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite** and stores data locally in your
browser.

## Features

- **Mood Entry** – track mood and optional notes.
  When geolocation is available the entry is tagged with your coordinates.
- **Calendar** – view past entries on a monthly calendar and tap a day to see
  details.
- **Light Therapy Scheduler** – set daily times to receive notifications reminding you
  about therapy activities.
- **Customization** – toggle dark mode, choose a seasonal theme (Spring, Summer,
  Autumn or Winter), adjust notification frequency and set a daily check-in time.
- **Streak Counter** – see how many days in a row you've entered your mood.
- **Analytics** – visualize mood trends with interactive charts.
- **Mood Log** – browse previous entries and notes in a calendar view.
- **Onboarding Flow** – a welcome carousel followed by a permissions prompt for
  notifications and location.
- **Tip of the Day** – daily suggestions based on recent moods with optional
  reminders.
- **Wellness Challenge** – join a 30 day challenge to complete simple wellness
  tasks.
- **Premium Tier** – unlock the 60‑day insights chart after starting a free
  trial.

## Feature details

### Onboarding flow

First time visitors see a short **Welcome Carousel** followed by a
permissions page. The carousel introduces mood logging, insights and daily tips.
The permissions screen requests notifications and geolocation so the app can
send reminders and tag entries with location data.

### Mood log

Mood entries are stored locally and can be reviewed from the **Calendar** page.
Tapping any day shows the recorded mood and notes.

### Insights chart

The **Analytics** page displays a line chart plotting recent mood ratings and
daylight hours. Hovering a point reveals sunrise, sunset and weather details.

### Tip of the Day

Daily tips are selected from `src/tips/tips.json` based on recent moods. Visit
`/tip` to view today's tip and optionally schedule a reminder notification.

### Wellness challenge

The **Challenge** page runs a simple 30‑step challenge. Joining tracks your
progress and displays confetti when completed.

### Premium tier

A modal appears a week after first use offering a free trial. Starting the trial
unlocks the 60‑day mood trend on the analytics page.

## Browser requirements

The app asks for permission to send **notifications** and to access
**geolocation**. Notifications are used by the therapy scheduler and daily
check‑ins. Geolocation allows mood entries to be tagged with your location. All
features continue to work if permissions are declined, but reminders and
location data will be unavailable.

When first opening the site most browsers display a prompt requesting these
permissions. If you previously denied access, you can re-enable them from the
site information panel – usually accessed via the lock icon next to the address
bar – and set notifications and location to **Allow**.

## Node.js requirement

This project relies on features from Node.js 18 or newer. Ensure you are running
Node **18+** before installing dependencies and running the development scripts.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies before running any build, test or lint step. **Skipping this will cause `npm run lint` to fail.**

```bash
npm install
```

This also installs the charting libraries `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2`
used by the analytics page.

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the linter once dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Styles are generated by Vite and Tailwind during the build or development process.
You'll only see them when running `npm run dev` or after building with `npm run build`
and serving the files from the `dist/` directory. Opening `index.html` directly
without building will omit all CSS.

## Deployment

Build the optimized production bundle and preview it locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

`npm run preview` serves the `dist/` folder using Vite's preview command so you
can verify the production build.

## Production Deployment

Running `npm run build` outputs a static `dist/` directory that can be served by
any static host. Popular options include **Vercel**, **Netlify** and **GitHub
Pages**. Make sure the site is served over **HTTPS** so browser notifications
and geolocation work correctly. All data is stored locally in the user's
browser, so no backend is required.

## User preferences and seasonal theming

Customization settings are managed with a zustand store and persisted to
`localStorage`. On the **Customize** page you can toggle dark mode, select a
season and set how frequently notifications should appear. Each season maps to
a background gradient and optional illustration loaded from the `public/`
folder. Selecting a different season instantly changes the look of the app.
These choices are loaded when the app starts so your preferred theme and
settings remain across visits.

## Styling

All colors and fonts are centralized in `tailwind.config.cjs` and `index.css`.
The palette defines `primary`, `yellow`, `paleSky`, `indigo`, `creamWhite` and
`mutedBlueGray`. The default font family is **Nunito** which is loaded in
`index.html` and applied globally via the `font-nunito` utility. Referencing
these variables keeps styling consistent across components.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
  ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
  ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```

## Calendar and date utilities

The calendar page uses [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) for working with
dates. Install dependencies, including this library, with:

```bash
npm install
```

See `src/pages/Calendar.tsx` for usage examples.

## Analytics and charts

Mood trends are visualized using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) via the
`react-chartjs-2` bindings. Both packages are installed with the project
dependencies and loaded by the `Analytics` page under `src/pages/Analytics.tsx`.
