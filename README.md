# Seasonal Mood Tracker

A small web app for recording moods and scheduling therapy reminders. It is built
with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite** and stores data locally in your
browser.

## Features

- **Mood Entry** – track mood, energy, sleep quality, light exposure and notes.
  When geolocation is available the entry is tagged with your coordinates.
- **Calendar** – view past entries on a monthly calendar and tap a day to see
  details.
- **Therapy Scheduler** – set daily times to receive notifications reminding you
  about therapy activities.
- **Timer** – a simple countdown timer.
- **Customization** – toggle dark mode, choose a seasonal theme (Spring, Summer,
  Autumn or Winter) and adjust notification frequency.
- **Streak Counter** – see how many days in a row you've entered your mood.
- **Analytics** – visualize mood trends and light exposure with interactive charts.

## Browser requirements

The app asks for permission to send **notifications** and to access
**geolocation**. Notifications are used by the therapy scheduler and daily
check‑ins. Geolocation allows mood entries to be tagged with your location. All
features continue to work if permissions are declined, but reminders and
location data will be unavailable.

## Node.js requirement

This project relies on features from Node.js 18 or newer. Ensure you are running
Node **18+** before installing dependencies and running the development scripts.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies before running any build, test or lint step. **Skipping this will cause `npm run lint` to fail.**

```bash
npm install
```

This also installs the charting libraries `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2`
used by the analytics page.

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the linter once dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Styles are generated by Vite and Tailwind during the build or development process.
You'll only see them when running `npm run dev` or after building with `npm run build`
and serving the files from the `dist/` directory. Opening `index.html` directly
without building will omit all CSS.

## User preferences and seasonal theming

Customization settings are managed with a zustand store and persisted to
`localStorage`. On the **Customize** page you can toggle dark mode, select a
season and set how frequently notifications should appear. Each season maps to
a background gradient and optional illustration loaded from the `public/`
folder. Selecting a different season instantly changes the look of the app.
These choices are loaded when the app starts so your preferred theme and
settings remain across visits.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
  ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
  ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```

## Calendar and date utilities

The calendar page uses [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) for working with
dates. Install dependencies, including this library, with:

```bash
npm install
```

See `src/pages/Calendar.tsx` for usage examples.

## Analytics and charts

Mood trends are visualized using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) via the
`react-chartjs-2` bindings. Both packages are installed with the project
dependencies and loaded by the `Analytics` page under `src/pages/Analytics.tsx`.
